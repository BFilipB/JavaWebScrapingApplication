# Libraries
**Selenium**

[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)
Selenium automates browsers. That's it!
What you do with that power is entirely up to you.

Primarily it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that.

Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should) also be automated as well.

# Gradle
Description
Gradle is an open-source build-automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven for declaring the project configuration
